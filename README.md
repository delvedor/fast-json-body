[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://standardjs.com/) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/delvedor/fast-json-body.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/delvedor/fast-json-body)

`fast-json-body` is a crazy fast json body parser, its fully asynchronous and does not change the request object.  
At the time of writing is **~100% faster** than `body` and `body-parser`.

With the [testing server](https://github.com/delvedor/fast-json-body/blob/master/server.js) and the [benchmark script](https://github.com/delvedor/fast-json-body/blob/master/package.json#L8), `fast-json-body` can parse up to 40k request per second.

## Install
```
npm install fast-json-body --save
```

## Usage
`fast-json-body` exposes one function, that takes two parameters, the request object and a callback.  
The callback has two parameters, error and body.

## Example
```js
'use strict'

const http = require('http')
const jsonBody = require('fast-json-body')

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  jsonBody(req, (err, body) => {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err)
      return res.end()
    }
    res.end(JSON.stringify(body))
  })
})

server.listen(3000)
```

## Benchmark
Run the following command in two different CLIs
```bash
$ npm run server
$ npm run bench
```
